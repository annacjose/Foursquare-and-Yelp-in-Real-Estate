# MINI-PROJECT-2
 
In this miniproject, we will combine and practice topics that we have learned in previous two weeks:

APIs
Databases (SQL)
Pandas
Processing special data types in Python
We will work with these APIs:

Foursquare - we have already come across this one
Yelp - this API offers similar services as Foursquare.
(Stretch) Google Places API - this google api offers similar service as well.
The main goal of the mini-project is to build the database of restaurants, bars and various points of interest (POIs) in the area of your choice and find out which API has better coverage in the selected area.
