# MINI-PROJECT-2
 
Foursquare and Yelp - Real Estate
 
In this miniproject, the following are the topics that were involved:
APIs
Databases (SQL)
Pandas
Processing special data types in Python

I worked on the following APIs:

Foursquare
Yelp - this API offers similar services as Foursquare
Google Places API - this google api offers similar service as well

The main goal of the mini-project is to build the database of real estate offices and various points of interest (POIs) in the area of your choice and find out which API has better coverage in the selected area.
